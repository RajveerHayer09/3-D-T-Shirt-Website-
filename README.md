# 3-D-T-Shirt-Website-
This website is a 3-D model t-shirt customisation website using AI .
Technologies used : ReactJS, Javascript, NodeJS.
The 3-D modelling was done using ThreeJS , other libraries like framer-motion was used for having beautiful animations, cloudinary. 
Here ,we can do :
1. Custom selection of colours.
2. Putting or removing a ThreeJS logo in center of t-shirt and on the whole t-shirt.
3. Upload an image which can be used as custom logo for both full t-shirt or center or t-shirt.
4. Ask AI  to create a custom image using text-to-image AI (openai dalle api). This image can be used as logo or the pattern as well.
5. Download the image of the designed t-shirt by just a simple click or a button.

EDIT: Unfortunately, the Dalle has monitized the use of API which was earlier free and therefore it is not working now and may show error.
